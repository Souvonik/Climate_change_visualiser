Climate Change Visualization Portal 

Introduction 

Climate change is no longer a distant concern — it is a global reality. Understanding its patterns, impact, and future trends is essential for individuals, organizations, and policymakers alike. To make climate data accessible and visually compelling, we have developed an interactive web-based portal that allows users to explore over a century's worth of temperature data for countries around the world. 

Website Overview 

Our portal is designed to visualize monthly temperature data from 1901 to 2100 for various countries using interactive area charts. It offers an intuitive and engaging user interface for exploring historical climate trends and forecasted temperature changes. 

Key Features 

Interactive Visualizations: Explore temperature trends across time using dynamic area charts. 

Country Selection: Choose from a global list of countries. 

Year Navigation: Scroll through data from 1901 to 2100 using a timeline control. 

Smooth Transitions: Seamless animations and updates for an engaging experience. 

Data Source and Methodology 

The dataset includes monthly average temperatures from 1901 to 2020, sourced from reliable global climate databases. For the years 2021 to 2100, the temperature data has been forecasted using machine learning techniques, particularly Facebook Prophet, a robust time series forecasting model. 

This ensures continuity and offers valuable insights into future climate trends, aiding awareness and strategic planning.
